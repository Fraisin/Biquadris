# Biquadris

Biquadris is a 2-player twist on the classic game of Tetris. Players take turns placing down pieces, trying to avoid death by continuously clearing lines. The difference between Biquadris and Tetris is that a player must wait for the other player's turn to be completely over before playing, allowing for Chess-like gameplay.

### Features

* 4 Different Levels to Play From!
* Special Effects, including Blind, Heavy and Force
* Keyboard Input & Aesthetic Graphics
* Large Variety of Commands

Players are able to change levels on the fly, take in block sequences from text files, and more!
